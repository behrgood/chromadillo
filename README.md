 ###GA WDI DC 3 October 31, 2014: Project 1

 ##Overview

 Chromadillo is a rails app designed to create a beginner's style guide for web-based projects. It does so by generating a font-pair and color-scheme based off of the user's input via dropdown select.

 ##Technologies Used

 - Ruby 2
 - Ruby on Rails 4
 - SQLite3 Database
 - Ruby Gem: 'Devise'


 ##User Stories

 A user should land on the home page and be presented with three dropdown menus: base color, project type, and color palette type.

 A user should be presented with one style guide arrangement upon clicking "generate". If the user is unsatisfied with the current generated scheme, the user should immediately have the choice to generate a new arrangement with new or identical parameters. This process should repeat until the user is pleased with the results.
